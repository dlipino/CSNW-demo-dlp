## Additional Materials

Sadly I don't have much here. I haven't been active on any open source projects and I also don't post much.

My only supporting material for my candidacy would be my former coworkers:
- Bharath Modayur - Founder of Early Marker
- William Constantine - One of the principles at Xyonix

They are both available to chat, and I can provide their contact information upon request.

Additional contacts would be Deep and Carsten from Xyonix, but I haven't asked them if they were up for a chat yet.
I hold these people in high regard and also consider them my friends.

I am sure they will give a proper run down of my strengths and weaknesses in the most brutally honest way possible.
